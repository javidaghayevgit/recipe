        "about": "Bake this dish for your family and they'll swear it came straight from Italy! Use pan lining paper to fit your favorite baking pan and avoid those baked on messes. Simply flip your pan over and press a sheet of pan lining paper around it. Next, remove the paper, flip the pan over and drop the paper inside. Then you just have to crimp the edges around the rim of the pan, fill it with your pasta and bake. When you're done, simply toss out the pan lining paper and rinse the pan.",

        "about": "Instead of any tomato-based sauce, a luxurious cream sauce, bolstered with thyme, garlic, and a touch of lemon zest, holds together tender lasagna sheets and savory, meaty mushrooms here.
